# Week12_Lab
### Running
In order to run what we have done thus far, launch the server and two clients as
per usual. Enter names for both of the clients, then connect the two. This should
launch the game. Press ENTER to play!

### Requirements
Python 3.X with framework supported. Must have `pygame` installed.

### Limitations
Unless there is additional time at the end of the project, this system will be limited
to two players.
